# Dengue_outbreak_in_Dhaka_Analysis

## Key Insights: 

- **Total affected**-53% from 1,000 patients.
- **Most affected**- people aged above 45
- **The riskiest area** - Jatrabari(underdeveloped) has 31 cases positive.
- **HouseType**- Buildings are more risky as there's a chance for a dengue mosquito to lay its eggs in water-filled containers inside the house. 
- **Gender-** Females have a higher rate (53%) of being dengue-positive. 252 male & 281 female have been found positive.

 ### Area Type Analysis:

- Developed areas seem to have more dengue cases than undeveloped ones, particularly in Jatrabari and Demra. This may be due to higher population density or other environmental factors like construction sites and stagnant water bodies in developed areas.

### House Type Impact:

- The majority of dengue cases are found in buildings (36%) and tin shed homes (32%), suggesting that these types of dwellings might be more susceptible to mosquito breeding conditions compared to other types of houses.

### Test Type Comparison:

-The tests conducted show almost equal distribution among the three types: IgG (34%), IgM (31.1%), and NS1 (34.9%). This suggests that the testing methods are well-balanced, ensuring a comprehensive diagnosis.

## Conclusions:

Adults are the most affected group with 263 cases, followed by seniors with 169 cases, and children being the least affected with 101 cases. This indicates that adults might be more exposed to outdoor environments or that children may be better protected.
